This repository contains all files needed to create the user interface for our project: index.html, style.css, and picture bg3.jpg. NOTE: ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER, IN ORDER FOR ALL THREE FILES TO WORK TOGETHER, ADD THE PICTURE bg3.jpg INTO A FOLDER NAMED "images".

The website can be previewed at https://tiu-swe-group.github.io/UserInterface/ or can be launched by running the following command in the folder after downloading it `python3 -m http.server`.
